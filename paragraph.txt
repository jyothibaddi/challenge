SkyShield â€“ Flight Takeoff Readiness Checker is a lightweight decision-support system designed to quickly evaluate whether an aircraft is ready for safe departure. The tool takes into account key factors such as weather conditions, aircraft health checks, pilot duty hours, and runway status, then calculates a readiness score. Based on the score, it clearly indicates if the flight is Ready, requires a Delay, or is Not Ready. This project aims to demonstrate how automation can support aviation safety and operational efficiency, while being easy to use for training, simulations, or presentations.
